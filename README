INTRODUCTION

Hello and thanks for checking out DVDKit.

DVDKit was originally part of RipIt, the simplest DVD ripper available for the 
Macintosh, and is now available to the public.

DVD players are complex beasts, and there's precious little publicly available
documentation on how they work and why they do what they do.  DVDKit was my 
attempt at gathering this mess into a coherent set of classes that could be 
used to properly simulate a DVD player during normal operation.

As part of RipIt, DVDKit has been extensively tested against more than 10,000
different discs, with compatibility in excess of 99.6%.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

running DVDKit on older versions of Mac OS X.
